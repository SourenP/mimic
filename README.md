### Ideas for more mechanics
- [ ] Aquire disadvantage of animal you mimicked in addition to advantage
  - Create predator animals that will hunt you if they are your pray
- [ ] Give certain animals the ability to modify tiles
  - e.g. bug can eat (clear) grass tiles
- [ ] Give certain animals special movement patterns
  - e.g. Frog that can jump over tiles that it's not able to normally walk on
  - e.g. Bird that can fly over river (can move tree->river and river->tree but not river->river)
- [ ] Use the environment to be able to mimic an animals movement
  - e.g. push a rock in front of an animal to change their movement into a pattern you're able to mimic
