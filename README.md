### Todo

- [ ] Remind of restart button when player stuck
- [ ] Add level system and more levels
- [ ] Add music
- [ ] Redesign mimic pattern requirements
  - It might be the case that you can only the loop at one start/end position and sometimes this forces you to do the loop more than 1 times to transform.
