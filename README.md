### Todo

- [ ] Remind of restart button when player stuck
- [ ] Add level system and more levels
- [ ] Add music
- [ ] Redesign mimic pattern requirements
  - I think the loop only registers at one start/end position in the pattern. This forces you to do the loop more than once to transform and throws players off.
